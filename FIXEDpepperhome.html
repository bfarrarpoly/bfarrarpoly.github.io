		<h1>Dr. Pepper is the Drink of True Intellectuals</h1>
		<p>A lot of people ask me every day: what can I drink to signal to others that my mind shines brightly through the murk of ignorance? That I value truth and knowledge, and understand the virtues of a truly exceptional beverage?</p>
		<h3><i>Fear not, friend, and look no further!</i></h3>

		<h3>The following is a true story</h3>
		<p class="helv">I sent my dog Pepper to dog college so he could get his PhD.</p>
		<p class="helv">It was a long journey, but he received his doctorate after 11 years of study.</p>
		<p class="helv">With his new title, he legally controls the source of this sweet nectar, and he ordered the installation of a dedicated pump in the factory to send it directly into our apartment.</p>
		<p class="helv">Sadly, soda is not for dogs.</p>
